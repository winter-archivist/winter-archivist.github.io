        The Children of Tesho: The Hykon
      </h2>

      <p class="introduction-text" id='introduction-opening-statement'>
In the distant past a cult began to form around the minor deity Tesho; 
it is currently unknown if Tesho is a Nibiru or Aphelion, though it is 
known that he has been around longer than most Aphelion.
Too are his domains known, they are that of Patience, Hunting, and Revenge.
<br>
<br>
This cult's name has been lost to time, most of their existance is truly, 
their practices or even their size, however rumours say the cult had a 
secret colony buried deep in the terain of Rothia. Its said that the cult
managed to forge a portal capable of leaving Rothia and entering Tesho's
Realm, a supposedly endless hunting ground which is said to be the origin
of Hycanthropy.
<br>
Though, those who go looking never return.
<br>
<br>
In modern times the cult has long since been disolved, splintered into various subgroups;
Only two of these groups are known to have survived to today:

The infection has taken hold in its new vessel, the newest member of the pack.
These newborns have been freshly subsumed their new maleable flesh is strange & unfamiliar, somewhere between human and not, it rebels, unfamiliar with its new found moldablity.
The vast majority of Bairn feel a strong connection to humanity and their human form, most choosing to stay in it as much as possible. 
Particularly strong Bairn will already begin to feel disconnection from their prior selves, while still comfortable in their human form, their hybrid form feels like the best middle ground for them.
For those whose humanity was already slipping, being turned by Hycanthropy is like ascension, though on the other side no sanity remains, they are a near mindless drones who serve the Pack with unmatched fervor. They have entirely shed their prior flesh and 'purpose', now they stalk as hyenas, destined for gold.
<br>
<br>
Bairn are typically sent to scout the region around the pack's den and nearby population centers. When they aren't scouting, Bairn are being trained by the Tawny & Grey of the pack. </p>

The infection's roots have well and truly embued itself with the host, staying under the disguise of mere-human is uncomfortable now, the flesh is could be so much more, why restrain it?

Most of any pack is Tawny, the workhorse of any pack.</p>
